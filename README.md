# slideShowNFC

Using Tkinter and the Pillow (PIL) package, this Python code develops a straightforward image slideshow with a graphical user interface (GUI). A succession of images from given URLs are loaded by the script and shown while transitioning between them in a slideshow fashion. Users can start and stop the slideshow using the "Start" and "Exit" buttons, respectively. For your unique use case, adjust the picture URLs, sizes, and delays as necessary.
